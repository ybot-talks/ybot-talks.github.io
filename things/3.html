<h1>Coca-Cola-Commerical-Concepts</h2>
<i>⇨ I do acknowledge that some of these Coca-Cola ad ideas sprang from a
conversation featuring other conversants: all of these ideas, however, belong
to me, and were formulated thereby. ⇦</i><br>
<h2>ONE</h2>
<p>Close-up profile shot of an unshaven man drinking Coca-Cola. The cola is
draining evenly and passionlessly down his throat. He finishes his swig. He
puts the bottle down. He faces the camera. "Coca-Cola is <i>really
foul!</i>"</p>
<h2>TWO</h2>
<p>Shot from point of view of dentistry victim of dentist. He is a-poking; he
is a-prodding. He makes a <i>tsk-tsk</i> sound. "You've been drinking too much
Coca-Cola!"</p>
<p>He sets down his instruments of art and wanders over to a table out of
eyeshot. He returns holding a bottle of Coca-Cola. He unscrews the lid and
begins to drink. He finishes his swig. "Now that's what I call Coca-Cola!"</p>
<h2>THREE</h3>
<p>A small circular rotating dais. A Coca-Cola bottle thereatop. Flashing over
this footage is the text, in yellow, "COCA-COLA: THE BEVERAGE THE POPE
DOES NOT WANT YOU TO DRINK."</p>
<h2>FOUR</h2>
<p>It is the news: but instead of newsreaders there are two Coca-Cola bottles on
the table. The chyron scrolls, and reads "Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola,"
etc.</p>
<h2>FOUR: VARIATION #2 THEREUPON</h2>
<p>Same as before, but there <i>are</i> newsreaders. But they are too busy
greedily guzzling brown Coca-Cola from bottles to read the news.</p>
<h2>FIVE</h2>
<p>We are in a bar, and the bar (the bar within the bar establishment) has
Coca-Cola bottles on it. The only occupant of the bar (the establishment
which contains the bar, not the physical bar itself: that can't <i>have</i>
occupants) is a man in a red suit. "Coca-Cola is not for me," he declares.
He then shoots all of the Coca-Cola bottles with his gun.</p>
<h2>SIX (Colin Firth must be cast, or else this idea is off the table.)</h2>
Coca-Cola. Dark brown cola. Rot your molar. Rot your teeth.<br>
Coca-Cola. Give me more. Coca-Cola. Brown soda drink.<br>
Coca-Cola. Brown and wet. Coca-Cola. Drunk it yet?<br>
Coca-Cola. Drink it up. Coca-Cola. Sup sup sup.<br>
Coca-Cola. Colin Firth. Coca-Cola. I'm Colin Firth.<br>
<h2>SEVEN</h2>
<p>The surgeon smiles sadly. "We're all out of anaesthetic. But we have
plenty of Coca-Cola. It does not have the same numbing effect as alcohol."</p>
