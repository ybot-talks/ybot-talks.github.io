<p> Here, with the cold glow of the TV, it is possible to imagine that the
slowmo apocalpyse unfolding is a show put on at great expense for our eerie
amusement. Just as the window renders the thunderbolt a queer comfort does the
distance between us and the dying the weeping the malformed the mutilated the
lost and found souls of the great brutalist moasaic which the snippets and
whippets of reality constitute in the cool and the quiet of our living roomâ€¦
ah. It seems that I have lost track of where that sentence was going. Sorry.
The kids are getting sleepy now; the adults will stay awhile in these bought
minutes.</p>
