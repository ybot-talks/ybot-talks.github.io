<b>FROM THE ARCHIVES</b>
<p>
    Before there was <a href = "1.html">tar</a>, there was pitch! Tasty and
    black: a tasty snack: this is an accurate description of both. In these
    pieces from the ybot archives (modified, to preserve privacy, from
    instant-message originals) Mr Maestro eats his fill.
</p>

<h1><i>Perfect Pitch</i></h1>

<p>"How's <i>that</i> for perfect pitch, eh?"</p>

<p> Mr Maestro is in no fit condition to answer; his mouth is gummed up with the
irresistible black polymer. The pitch is as molasses in terms of deliciosity
and viscosity—except much <i>more</i> delici- and viscous than that sugar
product. Tasty tar; beautiful bitumen; amazing asphalt. Another distinction,
MM begins to realise, between this palatial pitch and treacle both light
<a>and</a> dark is that one tends to tire of the taste of those sweeteners: but
there is nothing sickly sweet about this rich and rewarding resin. MM
continues to pile gobs of gobs into his gob; the spoon becomes blacker and
blacker, as does his mouth. No toothbrush could now restore MM's erstwhile
dentition; the actual structural integrity of his teeth and his gums and the
relationship therebetween is quite seriously in question. MM loves the
pitch; MM craves the pitch, even when the pitch is in his mouth; MM loves
the pitch. He loves it so much that he now dispenses with the dispenser—lobs
the spoon away—and plunges his face into the drum of pitch. He breathes in the
delicious pitch. The pitch seems paltry in the face of MM's overwhelming
desire; he feels curiously unsatisfied, even as his head is wholly surrounded
by wonderful, wonderful pitch. </p>

<p> "How's <a>that</a> for perfect pitch, eh?" </p>

<h1><i>Fever Pitch</i></h1>

"Pitch delicious<br>
Pitch divine<br>
Drink the pitch as if it's wine!<br><br>

Pitch aplenty<br>
Pitch galore<br>
Drink the pitch, then drink some more!"<br><br>

The chorus have reached fever pitch. And Mr Maestro is in terrific form; he
conducts them to victory.<br><br><br>
