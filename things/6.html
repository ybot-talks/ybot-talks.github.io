<h1>"I Can't Get No Satisfaction" with a twist</h1>

I can't get no automobile<br>
I can't get no automobile<br>
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try<br>
I can't get no, I can't get no<br><br>

I'm not driving in my car<br>
And that man comes on the radio<br>
And he's telling me more and more<br>
About some useless information<br>
Supposed to fire up my ignition<br>
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!<br>
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!<br><br>

I can't get no automobile<br>
I can't get no motor car steal<br>
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try<br>
I can't get no, I can't get no<br><br>

When I'm watching my TV<br>
And a man comes on and tells me<br>
How white my car can be<br>
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't drive<br>
The same dearth of car as me<br>
I can't get no, oh no, no, no<br>
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say<br><br>

I can't get no satisfaction<br>
I can't get no fast car action<br>
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try<br>
I can't get no, I can't get no<br><br>

When I'm biking round the world<br>
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that<br>
And I'm trying to get a car<br>
Auto dealer tells me, "Better come back, maybe next week"<br>
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak<br>
I can't get no, oh no, no, no<br>
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!<br>
I can't get no (×3)<br>
I can't get no automobile<br>
No satisfaction (×3)<br>
I can't get no<br><br>
