from the toaster. Now <i>that's</i> what I call cuisine! Now you gotta<br>
<i>Spread that tar all over the toast<br>
Spread it nice and good<br>
Spread tar on the bread and make a toast<br>
To the drunken Gods Of Food!</i><br><br>

you to be spreading (delicious tar!) tar on your tast, but it don't matter, and
it ain't a problem, because you're Munching As If There Were No Tomorrow.

correct. You. Have. Guessed. Correctly.<br><br>

The mayor is pouring black tar out of his black top hat into his mouth. Yummy
